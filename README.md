### [1] EER-diagram of the database


-----
### [2] API + Scraping

- API used: https://vejr.eu/pages/api-documentation

- Site scraped for weather data: https://vejr.tv2.dk/

### [3] Error handling & Edge cases

- We have tried handling most errors and edge cases, but there are still some that we have not been able to handle.
For example, we don't check if the API returns html after a response and 
not json, like it's supposed to. (Edit: fixed with a try-catch!)

### [5] Collaboration & Control

We've used Discord for communication and Github for version control. We've worked on different branches
and merged them into main when we were done with a feature. Instead of a Kanban Board, we've used an IntelliJ file called toDo,
in which we've written down what we need to do and edited it out once done. Had the project been on a larger scale, and not laid out for us on a day to day basis, we would've
once again used Github Projects own Kanban board for project control.
